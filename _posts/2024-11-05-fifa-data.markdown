### Analyzing a team' attacking strength by age
The age group between 24 and 26 years old shows relatively higher attacking strength. However, a higher overall score does not necessarily correlate with a higher attack rating. Teams with strong attacking power tend to have overall scores ranging between 60 and 80.
